        One of my long term interests is music production. Curiosity lead me to wonder how something was created so as a young avid music listener, I soon found myself taking a strong interest in music production.<br>
        <br> Around 2001-2002 when garage was almost dead another un-named scene was bubbling. Based more on vocals, radio sets, darker beats, and increasedly more rap influenced as time went by. Soon named grime.<br> Later on got more into hiphop and
        as a music producer who enjoyed sampling old music, it lead me down a path of discovery for alot of other genres I may not have listened to if it werent for music production.

      When I got more into programming, it kind of occured to me how similar the process felt to making music when it comes to focus. I'd spend hours on end tweaking something miniscule until I finally got it right. You have to pay attention to almost invisible details. <br>
      My friends sometimes looked at the screen and didnt get what the hell I was doing or what the sounds were supposed to be until things finally started getting together. <br>
      When this happens, the reactions on peoples faces are priceless moments to me.

      With music, the saying "its not a bug, its a feature" is very much an acceptable thought process.
